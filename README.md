It is a completely free and open source public rewrite of **Heroes Mod Loader**, my original first attempt at a mod management/loader system all the way from the ground up using the C# programming language.

At the time of writing of this readme, Reloaded has currently been in development for 5 months, plus the extra time spent on the predecessing mod loader, this included me learning many new aspects of hacking and reverse engineering from the ground up.
